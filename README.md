# benchmark_epig_celltyping
Benchmarking of approaches for cell typing from epigenetic marks

Idea is to test approaches at cell typing on scATAC-Seq data as the representative epigenetic data 
(there is a lot of public data available for it). The 'gold standard' or ground truth for this benchmarking
will be cell types derived from matched scRNA-Seq using standard approaches for cell typing 


The aim is to use this as a proof of concept for cell typing from other assays providing peak data such as scTip-Seq on H3K27ac.
