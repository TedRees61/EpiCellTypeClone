# benchmark_epig_celltyping
Benchmarking of approaches for cell typing from epigenetic marks

Idea is to test approaches at cell typing on scATAC-Seq data as the representative epigenetic data 
(there is a lot of public data for it). The 'gold standard' or ground truth for this benchmarking
will cell types derived from matched scRNA-Seq using standard approaches fro cell typing 
([scFlow](https://nf-co.re/scflow)).

The aim is to use this as a proof of concept for cell typing from scTip-Seq on H3K27ac.
